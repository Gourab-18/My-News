#About
This code sample is a basic news app which fetches data from a News API. This API is hacker news API which is one of the leading news site in the business world. In this project one can search for relevant news. One can read the news in depth as clicking on the news will guide them towards the relevant news article. One can remove the news too from the page if they want. Moreover, the website has proper pagination which allows the user to go through all the news articles they are interested in and read them.

#Learnings

Before I was very bad at implementing various basic features of Reactjs as well as Javascript. After completing the project I got hold of a lot of topics like useState,useReducer in react. In this project however I have used useReducer hook which got me curious about the reducer function in Javascript. I got introduced to various useful Javascript methods like map() and filter() which I have used extensively in my project.

Before I used to find working with APIs quite challenging but after working on this project I have become quite comfortable with working with APIs and playing around with them using the console.
One more new thing that I learned in this project was the use of Context APIs. Instead of using passing props to each and every component I learnt how to create a Global Context and use that in all functions. Before I used to find its syntax quite challenging but now after much trial and error I have become used to it.

I got a lot of clarity regarding spread operator after doing this project. Before I used to be really afraid of using it as I didnâ€™t have much clarity.
